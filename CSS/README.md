## History
### CSS 1
CSS 1 was adapted in 1996. It was difficult and less adapted by then recent browsers such as Internet Explorer 3, Internet Explorer 4 and Netscape 4.x. 

CSS 1 had font properties and specification for typeface and emphasis. The text attributes were supported such as spacing of letters and line of text. 

Alignment of text, positioning and tables were also added. Margin, padding, border and positioning for elements was also implemented. This recommendation was not maintained by W3C.

### CSS2
CSS2 is the improvement of CSS1. It removed the not fully interoperable features. It also included the browser extensions. 

It had many new features such as absolute, relative and fixed positioning of elements. It supported different media types. It also included new font properties such as shadow.

### CSS3
CSS3 is the most recent and currently used. It has XHTML specification. CSS3 has its major focus on modularisation and separation of concerns. 

Different modules now go through different stages of the recommendation process. CSS3 has support for almost all recent web browsers. 

It has even included new selectors along with new combinator and new pseudo-elements.
